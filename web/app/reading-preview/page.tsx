  { id: 'intuition', heading: 'A small adjustment, a better prediction', body: String.raw`A neural network learns by adjusting its **weights**. Each adjustment should move its prediction closer to the desired answer.

> **Key idea:** The gradient tells us which direction increases the error. We move in the opposite direction.

Keep the learning rate small enough that we can make a useful adjustment rather than overshooting.` },
  { id: 'equation', heading: 'The update rule', body: String.raw`The rule combines the current weight, the learning rate, and the gradient:

$$
w_{\mathrm{new}} = w_{\mathrm{old}} - \eta\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
$$

Here, $w$ is a weight, $\eta$ is the **learning rate**, and $L$ is the loss. The derivative measures how the loss changes as the weight changes.

If the gradient is positive, subtracting it reduces the weight. A negative gradient leads to an increase.` },
  { id: 'example', heading: 'Show it with numbers', body: String.raw`Suppose $w_{\mathrm{old}}=2$, $\eta=0.1$, and $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}=3$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
w_{\mathrm{new}} &= 2 - 0.1(3) \\
&= 2 - 0.3 \\
&= 1.7
\end{aligned}
$$

1. Multiply the gradient by the learning rate: the adjustment is $0.3$.
2. Subtract the adjustment from the old weight.
3. The new weight is $1.7$. Whether the next prediction improves must still be checked.` },

The step size matters: a large jump can overshoot.\n\n**The rule is local**, so we measure the loss again after updating.\n```' },
