# Implementation status

## Phase-one website slice

The current website establishes the user-facing shell for the learning harness: a quiet workspace, knowledge-map exploration, first-principles lesson reading, adjustable Teaching Gear, and contextual sidecar branches. State is kept in browser storage and is explicitly labeled as local to this device. Unknown topics now call the local FastAPI service and open a bounded draft graph in the same UI.

## Deliberate product decisions

The map screen shows relationships as suggested routes rather than hard prerequisites. The lesson screen keeps the main context visible while an exploration panel opens beside it. Quick, Guided, and Deep change the authored explanation depth. A selected passage can become the anchor for an exploration. Unknown topics explain that live generation is not connected instead of fabricating an answer.

## Backend slice now working

`backend/app` now provides a FastAPI modular-monolith boundary with PostgreSQL selected by `DATABASE_URL` in deployed environments and a SQLite local/test fallback. Versioned Alembic migrations preserve the existing graph, session, action, lesson, event, and learner-graph data. The deterministic graph/teaching provider remains intentionally labeled `limited_unverified`; it does not fabricate source support.

The backend now exposes camelCase learner-state contracts for activity events, evidence admission and supersession, canonical concept state, review queues, nested branches, and anchored versioned notes. Reading a lesson records activity only. Canonical state changes only from accepted evidence through the versioned learner-state reducer. The web UI has not yet connected these routes and still uses browser storage for its visible state.

The Production Learning Kernel is now implemented behind the existing teaching-action endpoint. Each action exposes a typed context, persisted teaching plan, and deterministic policy-validation result. Prerequisite traversal uses only `requires` edges and stops clearly on missing nodes, cycles, unsupported relationships, or traversal budgets. Quick, Guided, and Deep select distinct pedagogical sequences; contextual controls compile into local typed overrides. Existing lesson fields remain intact, so the UI does not need to parse lesson prose to understand policy decisions.

The deterministic provider remains `limited_unverified` and makes no claim of source-backed correctness, model verification, evidence, or calibrated mastery. Lesson reading does not advance the learner projection, failed actions do not advance lesson position, and idempotent retries do not duplicate committed artifacts or evidence.

## Living study notes

Each chat session can own a study note (Markdown vault file with `study_note`, `session_ids`, and `tutor_updates` frontmatter). Tutor synthesis runs as a background `note_synthesis` job and produces accept/edit/reject proposals — never silent rewrites. Section ownership (tutor/user/shared), tombstones, and session linkage live in the `note_section_provenance` sidecar, so the Markdown stays clean. The default mode proposes before writing; per-note `auto`/`never` modes and quiz-origin review checklists are supported.

## Next engineering slice

1. Add a model-provider abstraction with routing, structured outputs, citations, and real verifier steps behind the current contracts.
2. Generate arbitrary-topic graphs with provenance, confidence, prerequisite closure, and review gates.
3. Connect the existing workspace to durable sessions, learner state, branches, notes, and review queues.
4. Add assessment blueprints, item-family generation, similarity guards, solver validation, and calibrated knowledge tracing through the evidence-admission boundary.
5. Replace development learner headers with real authentication-derived ownership before hosted multi-user use.
6. Connect typed plan fields to UI affordances without redesigning the current workspace.

The current UI is intentionally ready to connect to those contracts without pretending those services already exist.
